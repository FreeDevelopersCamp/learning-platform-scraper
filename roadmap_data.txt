Important Tip
Make sure to build as many projects as possible
for each node of the roadmap.
You should be able to find an intern or Junior Frontend
Developer join after learning these three.
Start applying for jobs and keep learning.
Learn about Version Control Systems
& start using Git for your future projects.
Create your GitHub Profile and publish the
projects you have developed so far to GitHub.
Learn to use npm package manager. This should
be a quick one. Just get the basics and move on.
Create some project with React. Make sure to
install some external npm packages and include
API calls to fetch some external data.
There are several CSS frameworks available. You
can pick any. I would recommend learning Tailwind.
Learn about different Testing types and how to
test your frontend using something like Vitest.
Depending on the depth of your knowledge and your
projects, at this point, you should have enough knowledge
to find a Junior to Mid-level (maybe even senior) position
at any company. Keep learning and building projects till you
find a job. Your job will teach you a lot as well.
